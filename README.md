# CSC480 Final Project
### Kaggle House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques Competition
Group final project of Principles of Machine Learning  
This final project involved participating in the _House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques_ Kaggle competition  
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview

In this project, we analyzed and cleaned data related to homes in Ames, Iowa. We then used machine learning techniques to help identify what factors and variables influence the final price of homes in Ames, Iowa. 
This competition uses the Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price.

Many different models and techniques were used, however the best performing model we developed was a combination of a support vector machine and a XGBoost, where the predictions of both models were averaged together. 

**Final leaderboard position as of 9/1/25: 291 (93rd percentile)**  
(Note that this is a rolling leaderboard that clears entries after 2 months)
